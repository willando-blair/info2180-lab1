        <p>I am Willando Blair, a second year Software Engineering student and a Maths enthusiast. My favourite course is Net-Centric computing because it gives me the opportunity to better understand a resource that we have all come to know and love, the internet. I hope to work with Microsoft in the future as part of thier software development and maintencane team.</p>

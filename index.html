        <p>I am Willando Blair, a past student of the Calabar High School, second year Software Engineering student and a Maths enthusiast. 
             My favourite course is Net-Centric computing because it gives me the opportunity to better the internet's architecture.
              Closely following is Dynamic Web Development as it acts as a portal to a deeper understanding of the look and feel of the webpages on the internet that we have come to know and love.</p>
